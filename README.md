# 📲 Biometric Authentication Testing – Manual QA Coverage

This repository provides a comprehensive set of manual testing scenarios for **Biometric Authentication** in mobile apps. It ensures smooth functionality, security, and usability across different platforms, devices, and configurations.

## 🔐 1. Authentication & Session States

### Key Scenarios:
- Validate biometric authentication behavior for:
  - **Active/logged-in users**
  - **Auto-logged-out sessions** due to:
    - Token expiration (time-based or manual DB invalidation)
    - Password reset
    - Admin actions (e.g., account disabled, purged, or terminated)
  - **Manually logged-out users**
- Confirm biometric behavior across various authentication methods:
  - **LDAP / SAML / OAuth** (e.g., Google Sign-In)
- Test for:
  - Biometric login functionality before and after session termination
  - Password expiry, two-factor authentication, and lockout scenarios

---

## 🔄 2. App Lifecycle & Installation

### Key Scenarios:
- **App uninstall/reinstall** (with and without login)
- **Auto and manual app updates**
- **Biometric authentication behavior** with/without user permissions
- Behavior when biometric data is **blocked/unrecognized** at OS level

---

## 📱 3. Multi-Device & Multi-User Scenarios

### Key Scenarios:
- Same user logging in across **multiple devices**
- **Read-status synchronization** across devices after biometric authentication
- **Shared device** usage scenarios with multiple user accounts

---

## 🧭 4. Authentication Behavior & UI

### Key Scenarios:
- **Deep linking**: Verify navigation after tapping a biometric prompt
- Background/foreground behavior after logout or biometric failure
- **Offline behavior**: Confirm biometric login works without internet if the session is active
- **Biometric prompt appearance** during app launch (foreground/background)
- **“Do Not Disturb” mode**: Ensure no interference with biometric prompts
- **Error and success messages**: Display proper feedback on enabling/disabling biometric auth

---

## 🌐 5. Cross-Platform & Version Compatibility

### Key Scenarios:
- Test across **Android (v6 to v14)** and **iOS (v12 to v18)**
- Test on **various device brands** (e.g., Samsung, Pixel, iPhone 11, iPhone 13+)
- **App version compatibility** (e.g., 7.15.x onward)
- Cross-platform compatibility for **fingerprint** (Android) and **Face ID** (iOS)

---

## ⚙️ 6. Device States & Settings

### Key Scenarios:
- **Foreground**, **background**, **suspended**, **terminated** app states
- **Cache/data clearing**: Ensure persistence of biometric data and settings
- **Font scaling** and **accessibility settings**: Validate UI visibility
- **Power-saving/low battery modes**: Ensure authentication doesn’t fail due to power-saving
- **Notification permission changes** and **system settings**: Test biometric impact on overall device security

---

## 🚀 7. Performance & Load Testing

### Key Scenarios:
- **Concurrent biometric login attempts**: Verify system handles load
- **Biometric response time**: Ensure prompt times are ≤1.5s
- **Battery impact**: Check power consumption with repeated biometric logins
- **Memory usage & leaks**: Monitor for memory increases during continuous biometric prompts

---

## 🔒 8. Security & Privacy

### Key Scenarios:
- Verify **biometric data security** during transmission and storage
- **Sensitive data** protection: Ensure no personal information is exposed
- Test **privacy settings** and ensure proper handling of user data

---

## 📊 9. Analytics & Reporting

### Key Scenarios:
- Measure **success rates** of biometric logins
- Track **user engagement** via biometric authentication
- Report on **session token expiration** and authentication failure scenarios

---

## 🧪 10. Edge Case & Config-Based Testing

### Key Scenarios:
- **Expired license**: Ensure app behavior when license expires
- **Biometric data corruption**: Simulate issues with biometric data (e.g., removed/re-enrolled biometrics)
- **Biometric settings toggle**: Test rapid enabling/disabling without data corruption
- **Error handling**: Validate fallback to credential login after biometric failure

---

## ⏱️ 11. Session Token Management

### Key Scenarios:
- Verify behavior after **manual token invalidation**
- Validate that users can **re-authenticate** with biometrics after session expiration
