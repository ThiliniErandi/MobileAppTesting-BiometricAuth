📲 Biometric Authentication Testing – Manual QA Coverage Summary

This repository outlines comprehensive manual testing scenarios conducted on biometric authentication features across mobile apps, focusing on fingerprint and face recognition authentication methods. The aim is to ensure reliable, secure, and user-friendly biometric authentication across platforms and device types.

🔐 1. Authentication & Session States

Validate biometric authentication behavior for:

Active/logged-in users

Auto-logged-out sessions due to:

Token expiration (time-based/manual DB invalidation)

Password reset

Admin actions (e.g., account disabled, purged, or terminated)

Manually logged-out users

Confirm biometric functionality across different authentication methods:

LDAP / SAML / OAuth (e.g., Google Sign-In)

Test scenarios for:

Biometric login functionality before and after session termination

Password expiry, two-factor authentication, and lockout scenarios

🔄 2. App Lifecycle & Installation

App uninstall/reinstall (with and without login)

Auto and manual app updates

Biometric authentication behavior with/without user permissions

Behavior when biometric data is blocked or unrecognized at OS level

📱 3. Multi-Device & Multi-User Scenarios

Same user logging in across multiple devices

Read-status synchronization between devices after biometric authentication

Shared device scenarios with different user accounts using biometric authentication

🧭 4. Authentication Behavior & UI

Deep linking: Ensure correct navigation after tapping a biometric authentication prompt

Background/foreground behavior after logout or biometric failure

Offline handling: Confirm biometric login still works if session is active, even without internet connection

Biometric prompt appearance during app launch in both background and foreground states

“Do Not Disturb” mode: Ensure the prompt doesn’t interfere or fail in this state

Error and success messages: Proper UI feedback on enabling/disabling biometric auth

🌐 5. Cross-Platform & Version Compatibility

Android (v6 to v14) and iOS (v12 to v18) coverage

Different device brands (e.g., Samsung, Pixel, iPhone X, iPhone 13+)

Compatibility with app versions (e.g., 7.15.x onward)

Cross-OS compatibility: Ensure biometric auth works across platforms (e.g., fingerprint on Android, Face ID on iOS)

⚙️ 6. Device States & Settings

Foreground, background, suspended, terminated app states

Cache/data clearing: Ensure biometric data and settings persist after clearing app data

Font scaling and accessibility settings: Validate readability of biometric-related UI elements

Power-saving/low battery modes: Confirm biometric auth doesn’t fail in power-saving mode

Notification permission changes and system settings: Validate the effect of biometric settings on overall device security

🚀 7. Performance & Load Testing

Biometric authentication under load: Test performance with concurrent biometric authentication attempts

Biometric data response time: Measure prompt times from launch to successful authentication (should be ≤1.5s)

Battery impact: Check power consumption with repeated biometric login cycles

Memory usage & leaks: Monitor app memory usage during continuous biometric prompts

🔒 8. Security & Privacy

Ensure biometric data is securely transmitted and stored

Verify that sensitive data is not exposed during authentication processes

Ensure privacy settings and user data protection while using biometric authentication

📊 9. Analytics & Reporting

Track and analyze biometric login success rates

Measure user engagement through biometric login usage

Report on token lifetime and authentication failure scenarios

🧪 10. Edge Case & Config-Based Testing

Test biometric authentication behavior with:

Expired license: Verify app behavior after license expiry

Biometric data corruption: Simulate data issues (e.g., removed/re-enrolled biometrics)

Biometric settings toggle: Test rapid toggling of enabling/disabling biometric auth

Error handling: Validate fallback to credential login after biometric failure

⏱️ 11. Session Token Management

Test the expiration behavior of authentication tokens (with/without biometrics)

Validate that users can re-authenticate with biometrics after manual token invalidation
